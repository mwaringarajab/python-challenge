 🐾 Digital Pet (Virtual Pet Simulator)

Welcome to the **Digital Pet Simulator**, a Python-based virtual pet game where users can interact with a digital pet. You can feed it, play with it, train it, and more!

---

## 📌 Project Overview

This is a simple Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) project built in Python. It simulates the behavior of a virtual pet with attributes like `name`, `hunger`, `happiness`, and `energy`, and includes methods to interact with the pet.

---

## 🚀 Features

- Create and name your own digital pet
- Feed your pet to reduce hunger
- Play with your pet to increase happiness
- Let your pet rest to regain energy
- Optional: Train your pet to improve its skills
- Status checks and feedback messages based on the pet's state

## 🧰 Tech Stack

- **Language**: Python 3
- **Concepts Used**: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

## 🏗️ How It Works

Each pet is an instance of the `Pet` class. Here's a basic overview of the class structure:

```python
class Pet:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name
        self.hunger = 50
        self.happiness = 50
        self.energy = 50
        self.trained = False

    def feed(self):
        # Reduces hunger

    def play(self):
        # Increases happiness

    def rest(self):
        # Restores energy

    def train(self):
        # Optional training feature
🖥️ How to Run

Welcome to Digital Pet Simulator!
What would you like to name your pet? → Sparky

Sparky is feeling hungry 😞
1. Feed
2. Play
3. Rest
4. Train
5. Exit
→ 1
You fed Sparky. Hunger level is now 40/100.
